    <h1>Coding Challenge 5</h1>
    <p> John and his family went on a holiday to 5 different restruants </p>
    <pre>
        Bills

        1. $124
        2. $48
        3. $268
        4. $180
        5. $50
    </pre>
    <p>John likes to tip in the following way </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If bill < $50 , John tips 20% of the bill</li>
        <li>If $ 50 < bill < $200 , John tips 15% of the bill</li>
        <li>If bill > $200 , John tips 10% of the bill</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create an object with array for the bill values.</li>
        <li>Add a method to calculate the tip.</li>
        <li>This method should include a loop to iterate over all paid bills and do tip calculation.</li>
        <li>As an output, create
            <ul>
                <li>a new array containing all the tips.</li>
                <li>array containing final paid amounts (bill + tip).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Hint: Start with two empty arrays and fill them up in the loop.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mark's family also went on a holiday going to 4 different restruants. The bills were: $77, $375, $110 and $45.</p>
    <p>Mark likes to tip in the following way </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If bill < $100 , Mark tips 20% of the bill.</li>
        <li>If $ 100 < bill < $300 , Mark tips 10% of the bill.</li>
        <li>If bill > $300 , Mark tips 25% of the bill.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Implement the same functionality as before using Mark's tipping rules.</li>
        <li>Create a function (not a method) to calculate the average of a given array of tips. 
            <ul>
                <li>HINT: Loop over the array and in each iteration store current sum in a variable(starting from 0). After you have the sum of the array, divide it by the number of elements in it (average)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Calculate the average tip for each family.</li>
        <li>Log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average.</li>
    </ol>
